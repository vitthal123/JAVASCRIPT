// Assignment 10: Given an array of numbers, we have to find the number with the most frequency 
// and return it. If there are two or more numbers with the same most frequency then return the 
// biggest number.
// E.g: 
// Input: const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6, 7, 5];
// Output: 4

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6, 7, 5];

let dict={};
for i of numbers{
    
}
